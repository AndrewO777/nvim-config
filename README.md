# nvim-config
This is my basic nvim config with lsp

To get everything working go into lua/packer.lua and run :so followed by :PackerSync
if you get a error comment the line vim.cmd('colorscheme rose-pine'), line 17 then run :so and :PackerSync
then uncomment the line and run those two commands again
then go into each file in after/plugin and run :so in each one
