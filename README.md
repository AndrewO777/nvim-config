# nvim-config
This is my basic nvim config with lsp

Make sure to install packer.nvim from github. Packer is our plugin manager and it is needed for this config.

To get everything working go into lua/packer.lua and run :so followed by :PackerSync
if you get a error comment the line vim.cmd('colorscheme rose-pine'), line 17 then run :so and :PackerSync
then uncomment the line and run those two commands again
